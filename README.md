# Demo DeFi Trading Bot

A Python-based, bare-bones demo DeFi arbitrage application that monitors Uniswap
V3 pools on the Sepolia testnet, collects price data, calculates multiple
technical indicators, and applies some secret-sauce trading logic to determine
whether to execute a buy, sell, or do nothing.

No on-testnet-chain transactions are executed. It's just logs flying by.

This is my way of proving that the private repo actually exists.

2. **Install**: `poetry install`
